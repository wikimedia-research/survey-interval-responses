# Estimation with non-linearly scaled interval responses in surveys

If a survey question asks about how much time the responder took to complete a task -- with the latent quantity of interest being "median task completion time" -- presenting options such as "5-15 minutes" and "1-2 days" (instead of freeform text fields) reduces cognitive load and makes analysis simpler (survey taker does not have option to omit units when answering). The proposed methodology enables accurate inference on the quantity of interest given the survey responses in the form of intervals.
